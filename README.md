# SSW345-HW5

When thinking about design methods for the project, what proved most helpful was a combination of brainstorming and looking at similar technologies. 
The team constantly discussed at length what we wanted the bot to do, and used references to other existing Reward Bots to figure out what would work and make sense
to include in the design of the bot. 

What proved difficult when thinking about design methods for the project was thinking about what the bot should and should not do. When we started designing the bot, we had many
different ideas for what we wanted to include, without considering time constraints or overall lack of experience among the team, since only one person on the team had
prior experience programming a discord bot. If I had the ability to start the project over again, I would want to design a bot that more accurately represents the skill level of
our team.

On future projects, I think that employing customer interviews may be helpful in designing a better product. For this project, each of the team members acted as customers for this 
project, since all of us use Discord often. However, I think that asking customers not involved in the design process on features they would like to see in the project might 
prove more useful and result in a better designed project.


When implementing, testing, and integrating aspects of the bot, what proved to be most helpful was creating a testing Discord server made solely for testing the bot. With a
testing server, the team was capable of testing the bot freely without worry of bothering other people with flurries of messages. Being able to freely test the bot without worry 
enabled the team to figure out when something did not work properly as well as what needed to be implemented in order to allow the bot to do what it was designed to do. Pair
programming also proved useful in implementing, in that it allowed multiple eyes to observe what was going on in the code and motivate each of us to perform more work. 

As with any project, what was difficult was figuring out how to correctly implement the team's vision. There were often bugs and issues that arose as implementation and testing
went on, prompting the team to pause and spend time performing more research before continuing again with progress. If I would do anything different, it would have been starting
the project earlier, so that the team could do more research prior to implementation and be better prepared to handle bugs and issues. 

The main method of implementation/testing/integration I would like to use in future projects is pair programming. Pair programming, while a bit of a slower process since
multiple team members are working on one solution, can yield much better results that one person working on an issue. It can also help with motivation, because it can be
difficult for one person to motivate themselves to perform work, especially with the current circumstances. 


When thinking about process methods for the project, the kanban board proved to be very useful in project organization and direction. The kanban board enabled the team to have
guidance throughout the project's lifespan, serving as a constant reference for what comes next. Code review also helped make sure that everyone was using similar coding
conventions, so that anyone who may view the project in the future will not be confused by any differing practices or conventions.

What proved most difficult was attempting to implement all of the user stories that the team laid out in the kanban board. In the design phase, the team designed a bot
without thinking much on what the team was actually capable of doing, which ended up being reflected in our user stories. The team created user stories centered around the
original design of the bot, and as the project went on, the team realized that not all of the user stories were realistic, due to either time constraints or a lack of 
experience. Code review also proved difficult, since sometimes team members employed different conventions and practices. If I would change anything, it would be 
to say at the outset what coding conventions the team would follow for the entirety of the project, which would save time later in code review. 

The kanban board proved to be very useful in this project, so on future projects that will be hosted on GitHub, I would definitely like to utilize the kanban board again. The
board gives the project a clear direction and a sense of progression, since user stories on the board can be marked for review and marked as completed by members of the project.


Throughout the entirety of the project, some practices proved more useful in certain areas than others. For example, pair programming proved to be a major part of the
implementation of the project, and helped tremendously with bug fixes and initial implementations, since having multiple people working on one issue can make progress happen
faster. On the other hand, code review did not help much with the direct implementation of the bot project, but did enable the project's files to be more universally
readable, and helped each team member clearly read the code and better understand what it was trying to accomplish. But, both methods together proved to make a much better
project, in that pair programming moved progress along swiftly and code review made the project more understandable to anyone who was not on the team. The kanban board
did not contribute to any kind of direct implementation, but gave the team direction and always provided a next goal. On the other hand, having a personal testing server
contributed greatly to the progress of the implementation of the bot, but would have proven to be meaningless without the kanban board, since a project without direction is
doomed to fail. Each method employed served its own purpose, but all of those methods together enabled the team to make meaningful progress on the bot project.
